#Song
A playlist is considered a repeating playlist if any of the songs contain a reference to a previous song in the playlist. Otherwise, the playlist will end with the last song which points to None.

Implement a function is_repeating_playlist that, efficiently with respect to time used, returns true if a playlist is repeating or false if it is not.

For example, the following code prints "True" as both songs point to each other.

```
first = Song("Hello")
second = Song("Eye of the tiger")
    
first.next_song(second);
second.next_song(first);
    
print(first.is_repeating_playlist())

```
